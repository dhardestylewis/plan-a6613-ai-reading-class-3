# AI Reading Exercise: Class 3 - The Economic Impact of Urban Technologies

**Due:** Tuesday by 5pm  
**Points:** 1  
**Submitting:** a text entry box or a file upload

## AI Reading Exercise - Week 3
This week, we are moving beyond theory to test how modern AI tools source and synthesize information on urban topics. Your objective is to use an LLM to answer a core question related to this week's class session, while critically auditing the tool’s output for accuracy and depth.

Use an AI tool of your choice (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) to research the following:

> "What are three specific ways that cities are currently measuring the economic impact of urban technologies?"

## Requirements
Please create a brief (max 1-page) document with bulleted responses to the following:

*   **Tool & Process:** State which AI model you used and the specific prompt(s) you found most effective.
*   **Key Findings:** A concise summary of the three methodologies identified by the AI.
*   **Verification (The "Human-in-the-Loop" Check):**
    *   Provide three real-world citations (links to policy reports, academic papers, or news articles) that support these findings.
*   **Crucial:** Did the AI suggest a source that doesn't exist? Did it misattribute a policy? Note any "hallucinations" or inaccuracies here.
*   **Critical Reflection:** In 2-3 sentences, rate the utility of the AI’s response. Was it a helpful starting point, or did it require too much "babysitting" to be useful for a planner?

## Submission Logistics
*   **Due:** Tuesday by 5:00 PM (in the future, we'll ask for this to be completed in advance)
*   **Format:** Submit the document as a PDF, .docx, or via text entry.
*   **Grading:** This exercise is part of your Participation (20%) grade. We value the quality of your critique as much as the content of the answer.

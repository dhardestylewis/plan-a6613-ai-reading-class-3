### Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source code and audit materials for the "AI Reading Exercise: Class 3". The assignment required using a Generative AI tool to research specific methodologies for measuring the economic impact of urban technologies, conducting a "human-in-the-loop" verification of the results, and synthesizing the findings into a strict one-page academic document.

### Repository Structure

*   **`AI_Reading_Exercise_Class_3.tex.d/`**: Main directory containing the LaTeX source file (`.tex`) and the compiled PDF.
*   **`AI_Reading_Exercise_Class_3.tex.d/refs/`**: A collection of primary source PDFs for all citations used in the document (ISO Standard, NYC DDC Report, World Bank Challenge).
*   **`PROMPTS-LOG.md`**: A complete chronological log of every prompt sent to the AI agent during this session, documenting the iterative "audit" process.
*   **`CHANGELOG.md`**: A record of git commits tracking the evolution of the document.

### Key Methodologies Explored
1.  **ISO 37122**: Standardized indicators for smart cities.
2.  **LCCBA (Life Cycle Cost-Benefit Analysis)**: Financial modeling for resilient infrastructure (e.g., Utilidors).
3.  **Nowcasting**: Real-time economic monitoring via big data digital footprints.

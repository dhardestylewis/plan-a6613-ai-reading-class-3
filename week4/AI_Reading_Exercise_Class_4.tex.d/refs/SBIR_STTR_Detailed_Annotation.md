## Synthesis for Essay
- **Mechanism**: De-Risking Commercialization.
- **Evidence**: "non-dilutive funding" (Quote 1) + Phase I/II limits (Quote 3).
- **Argument**: Policy functions as a "public VC" to bridge the valley of death, allowing firms to focus on "disruptive innovations" (Quote 2) without market pressure.

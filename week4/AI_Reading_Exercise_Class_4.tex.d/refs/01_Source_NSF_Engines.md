## A unique program to grow and sustain regional innovation

Over the coming decade, the **NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) program** — led by the [NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP)](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest)— envisions supporting multiple flourishing **regional innovation ecosystems** across the U.S., spurring economic growth in **regions that have not fully participated in the technology boom** of the past few decades.

The program seeks to **catalyze and foster innovation ecosystems** across the United States to:
- Advance critical technologies like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced wireless and biotechnology.
- Address pressing national and societal challenges.
- Cultivate partnerships across industry, academia, government, nonprofits, civil society and communities of practice.
- Promote and stimulate economic growth and job creation.
- Spur regional innovation and talent.

On January 29, 2024, the U.S. National Science Foundation announced the first-ever NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) awards to 10 teams spanning universities, nonprofits, businesses and other organizations across the United States.

**Funding Scale:**
Each awardee team will receive an **initial $15 million over the next two years** with the potential to receive **up to $160 million each over the next decade**.

With a potential NSF investment of nearly **$1.6 billion over the next decade**, NSF Engines represent one of the single largest broad investments in **place-based research and development** in the nation's history – uniquely placing science and technology leadership as the central driver for regional economic competitiveness.

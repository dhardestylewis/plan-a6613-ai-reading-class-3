## Who We Are
America's Seed Fund provides technology-focused entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses with funding to develop their ideas and a **pathway to commercialization**. Powered by a network of federal agencies, entrepreneur support organizations, and the Small Business Administration (SBA), America's Seed Fund advances federal missions and fosters a culture of innovation in the United States.
As the sponsoring agency for America's Seed Fund, SBA guides the participating agency's implementation of their SBIR/STTR programs, monitors and reports on program progress to Congress, and aggregates agency solicitation information. The SBA's expert staff supports the program by administering the Policy Directive and liaising with participating federal agencies and technology entrepreneurs.
Each participating federal agency administers its own SBIR/STTR program within guidelines established by Congress. As of October 2024, agencies may issue a **Phase I** award (including modifications) up to **$314,363** and a **Phase II** award (including modifications) up to **$2,095,748** without seeking SBA approval. Any award above those levels will require a **waiver**. Agencies considering this authority should review SBIR/STTR Policy Directive §7(i)(4) for additional information.

Core Concept:
Innovation districts are geographic areas where leading-edge anchor institutions and companies cluster and connect with start-ups, business incubators, and accelerators. They are typically compact, transit-accessible, and technically-wired and offer mixed-use housing, office, and retail.

Mechanisms/Dilemmas identified:
1. The Disconnect Dilemma (Need for a Shared Agenda):
   - Physical realm must enable innovation, not just be vibrant.
   - Requires a "shared agenda" on advancing specific sub-sector expertise (e.g., precision medicine).
   - Without this, physical assets cannot strengthen connectivity or collaboration effectively.
   - Strategy: Intentionally creating nodes of certain actors in close proximity.

2. The Dead Zone Dilemma (Authenticity vs. New Development):
   - Risk of "shiny soulless structures" replacing historic fabric.
   - Need to preserve authenticity and identity.
   - "Big box" format of buildings can fray human-scaled urban fabric.
   - Challenge: Economic feasibility of rehabilitating old buildings vs. new construction (tax credits issue).

3. The Divide Dilemma (Integration with Neighborhoods):
   - Risk of innovation districts being isolated islands ("sterile, segregated institutional buildings").
   - Needs better connectivity to adjacent neighborhoods.
   - Strategies: Making edges more porous, building retail/mixed-use on campus edges.
   - Governance: New entities needed to tackle connectivity challenges (e.g., Oklahoma City example).

Key Insight:
"Collaborate to compete" approach. Leaders must leverage district assets intentionally.
Physical environment serves as an "innovation enabler".

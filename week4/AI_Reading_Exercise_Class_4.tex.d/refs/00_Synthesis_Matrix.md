# Synthesis Matrix: Mechanisms of Catalysis

| Policy Mechanism | Source Document | Key Evidence (Verbatim) | Page | Nuance / Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Place-Based R&D Investment** | `01_Source_NSF_Engines.md` | "potential to receive **up to $160 million each over the next decade**." | p.2 | NOT just a grant. Requires "**Strong, CEO-led organization**" (p.3) to govern the ecosystem. Targets "missing millions" regions. |
| **2. Strategic Density via Zoning** | `02_Source_Brookings...md` | "concentrating a mix of **research institutions, mature companies, start-ups**... in close geographic proximity." | p.1 | Density alone isn't enough; needs a "**shared agenda**" (p.3) and "**porous edges**" (p.5) to avoid becoming a "dead zone." |
| **3. De-Risking Commercialization** | `03_Source_SBIR_STTR.md` | "**awards non-dilutive funding**... chart a **path toward commercialization**" | p.1 | Functions as "Public VC." Critical differentiator is **equity free** (p.1) status, preserving founder control during high-risk R&D. |

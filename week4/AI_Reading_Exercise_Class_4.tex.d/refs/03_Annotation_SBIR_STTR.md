## 2. Verbatim Quotes with Page Traceback

### The Financial Mechanism (The "What")
> "**America’s Seed Fund awards non-dilutive funding**"
> — *Page 1, Paragraph 2*
> **Relevance**: The most critical term. "Non-dilutive" means the government takes no ownership, unlike VC. This *de-risks* the company.

### The Goal (The "Why")
> "chart a **path toward commercialization**"
> — *Page 1, Paragraph 2*
> **Relevance**: The goal isn't just "science" (like NSF research grants); it is *product* (commercialization).

### The Size of the Bridge (The "How Much")
> "Phase I award... up to **$314,363**... Phase II award... up to **$2,095,748**"
> — *Page 3, Section "Funding Caps"*
> **Relevance**: Defines the exact size of the "Valley of Death" bridge this policy builds.

## 3. Synthesis for Essay
This document provides the evidence for **Mechanism 3: De-Risking Commercialization**.
- **Argument**: SBIR acts as "Public VC," funding the risky early stages that private markets won't touch.
- **Nuance**: It is "equity free" (Page 1), allowing founders to keep control.

## Introduction

The global rise of **innovation districts** continues. In the United States alone, roughly 20 districts have reached a level of critical mass to warrant the name, concentrating a mix of **research institutions, mature companies, start-ups and scale-ups, co-working spaces, and supportive intermediaries** in close geographic proximity.

Brookings first described this **new model of innovation in cities** and urbanizing areas five years ago, and since then researchers and practitioners around the globe have been exploring how to help them thrive. Driven by broader economic and demographic trends, most districts emerge organically as established firms and start-ups choose to **co-locate around universities, medical institutions and/or other anchors**.

## The Collaborative Approach

But over time, as the number of actors increases, innovation district leaders often become much more intentional about working together to leverage their district assets, applying a “**collaborate to compete**” approach.

Yet even with the best intentions, considerable resources, and unbridled ambition, many innovation district leaders are challenged in their efforts to create a balance between growing the innovation economy, enhancing social and professional networks, and creating a **high quality physical environment** that facilitates both.

## The Disconnect Dilemma

An important role of an innovation district’s physical realm is to **enable innovation**. While creating vibrant, magnetic, and walkable experiences is a valuable outcome for all districts, these geographies must also ambitiously leverage their assets to create a unique value proposition.

A **shared agenda** on advancing a particular sub-sector expertise... typically requires the engagement of many actors. A clear articulation of this agenda then helps guide and enable the right physical moves and strategies to **strengthen connectivity** and **increase collaboration**.

“Disconnected” districts that have not gone through an exercise of developing a shared agenda are far less able to use their **physical assets as innovation enablers**.

## The Dead Zone Dilemma

Sometimes, emerging and even maturing districts have made too many changes, too quickly, to their physical environment, sacrificing **authenticity and a sense of identity** in the process.

In my work, many entrepreneurs and some researchers have shared somber stories about how historic “gritty” buildings were lost to make space for modern buildings of steel and glass, described by one entrepreneur as “**shiny soulless structures.**” In other districts, buildings with **large floorplates**—often desirable in software fields—have frayed the **human-scaled urban fabric**.

## The Divide Dilemma

This third dilemma occurs in innovation districts that possess diverse, connected neighborhood-serving areas in one part of the district, while other areas are characterized by **sterile, segregated institutional buildings**.

As a consequence, the physical line between institutions and other district areas and activities can feel divisive even without barriers such as gates, vegetation, or setbacks from the street. While some universities have found strategies to make their **edges more porous** (e.g., building retail and mixed-use developments on campus edges), many still remain inwardly focused and isolated.

## A unique program to grow and sustain regional innovation
Over the coming decade, the NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) program — led by the [NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP)](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest)— envisions supporting multiple flourishing regional innovation ecosystems across the U.S., spurring economic growth in regions that have not fully participated in the technology boom of the past few decades.
The program seeks to catalyze and foster innovation ecosystems across the United States to:
- Advance critical technologies like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced wireless and biotechnology.
- Address pressing national and societal challenges.
- Cultivate partnerships across industry, academia, government, nonprofits, civil society and communities of practice.
- Promote and stimulate economic growth and job creation.
- Spur regional innovation and talent.

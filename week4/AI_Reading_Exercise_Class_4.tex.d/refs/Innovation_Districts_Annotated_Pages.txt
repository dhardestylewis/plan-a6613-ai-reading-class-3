## Page 1: Definition & Context
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**concentrating a mix of research institutions, mature companies, start-ups and scale-ups, co-working spaces, and supportive intermediaries in close geographic proximity.**" (Para 1)
    - *Note*: Defines the physical asset mix.
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**most districts emerge organically... But over time... leaders often become much more intentional about working together to leverage their district assets, applying a 'collaborate to compete' approach.**" (Para 2)

## Page 2: The Physical Challenge
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**It is much harder to find a consistent quality of place across most districts.**" (Para 4)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**place-based dilemmas that are contributing... to the development of underwhelming or downright disappointing districts.**" (Para 4)

## Page 3: The Disconnect Dilemma
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**An important role of an innovation district’s physical realm is to enable innovation.**" (Para 5)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**A clear articulation of this agenda then helps guide and enable the right physical moves.**" (Para 6)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**“Disconnected” districts that have not gone through an exercise of developing a shared agenda are far less able to use their physical assets as innovation enablers.**" (Para 6)

## Page 4: The Dead Zone Dilemma
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**sacrificing authenticity and a sense of identity in the process.**" (Para 7)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**historic “gritty” buildings were lost to make space for... “shiny soulless structures.”**" (Para 7)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**buildings with large floorplates... have frayed the human-scaled urban fabric.**" (Para 8)

## Page 5: The Divide Dilemma
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**sterile, segregated institutional buildings.**" (Para 11)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**physical line between institutions and other district areas... can feel divisive even without barriers**" (Para 11)

## Page 6: Solutions
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**strategies to make their edges more porous (e.g., building retail and mixed-use developments on campus edges)**" (Para 12)
- **Verbatim Quote**: "**created a new innovation district governance entity to tackle these and other challenges.**" (Para 12 - OKC Example)

## Outline Construction
1.  **Definition**: Geographic concentration of mixed assets (Page 1).
2.  **Problem**: Physical realm often fails (Page 2).
3.  **Dilemma 1 (Disconnect)**: Lack of shared agenda prevents innovation enablement (Page 3).
4.  **Dilemma 2 (Dead Zone)**: Loss of authenticity/human scale (Page 4).
5.  **Dilemma 3 (Divide)**: Segregation/Sterility (Page 5).
6.  **Solution**: Porous edges and Governance (Page 6).

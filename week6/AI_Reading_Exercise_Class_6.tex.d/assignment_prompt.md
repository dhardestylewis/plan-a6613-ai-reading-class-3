AI Reading Exercise: Class 6 - Urban Development in an Age of Automation 
Due Tuesday by 12pm Points 1 Submitting a text entry box or a file upload
AI Reading Exercise - Week 6
We will again test the power and limitations of modern AI tools for sourcing and synthesizing relevant information. Your objective is to use an LLM to answer a core question related to this week's class session, while critically auditing the tool's output for accuracy and depth.

Use an AI tool of your choice (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) to research the following question:

"Identify two examples of 'agentic' urban systems (systems that make autonomous decisions in real-time) and explain how their governance models address—or fail to address—public transparency and community consent."

Requirements
Please create a brief (max 1-page) document with bulleted responses to the following:

Tool & Process: State which AI model you used and the specific prompt(s) you found most effective.

Key Findings: A concise summary of the three methodologies identified by the AI.

Verification (The "Human-in-the-Loop" Check): * Provide three real-world citations (links to policy reports, academic papers, or news articles) that support these findings.

Crucial: Did the AI suggest a source that doesn't exist? Did it misattribute a policy? Note any "hallucinations" or inaccuracies here.

Critical Reflection: In 2-3 sentences, rate the utility of the AI's response. Was it a helpful starting point, or did it require too much "babysitting" to be useful for a planner?

Submission Logistics
Due: Tuesday Feb. 24 by 12:00 PM 

Format: Submit the document as a PDF, .docx, or via text entry.

Grading: This exercise is part of your Participation (20%) grade. We value the quality of your critique as much as the content of the answer.

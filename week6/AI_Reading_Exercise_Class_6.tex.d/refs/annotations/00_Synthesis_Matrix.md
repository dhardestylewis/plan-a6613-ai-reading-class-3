# Synthesis Matrix: Agentic Urban Systems and Governance

## Cross-Source Verification

| Dimension | ShotSpotter/Chicago | Sidewalk Labs/Toronto |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Autonomy level** | Fully autonomous detection → police dispatch within 60s | Proposed: adaptive signals, automated waste, real-time energy |
| **Deployment status** | Operational 2012-2024; contract ended Sept 2024 | Proposed only; cancelled May 2020 before construction |
| **Data controller** | SoundThinking (vendor); proprietary algorithm | Proposed: Civic Data Trust (never established) |
| **Community consent** | None: sensors placed without public hearings | None: RFP process excluded residents; expansion had no mandate |
| **Transparency mechanism** | None: proprietary algorithm; vendor controls accuracy narrative | Proposed but unenforceable: third-party privacy voluntary |
| **Independent audit** | Yes: Chicago OIG (2021); contradicted vendor claims | No: privacy advisors resigned before any audit could occur |
| **Equity dimension** | Sensors exclusively in Black/Latino neighborhoods | Development would displace existing waterfront communities |
| **Outcome** | Contract ended after sustained public pressure | Project cancelled; cited COVID but governance failures central |

## What Claude Missed (Both Cases)

1. **Stakeholder interests**: Claude reported vendor claims at face value without noting who benefits financially
2. **Governance vs. governance theater**: Claude described proposed governance (Civic Data Trust) and vendor accuracy (97%) as credible without checking whether either had enforcement or independent verification
3. **Community exclusion**: In both cases, the affected communities were not consulted before deployment or development — Claude did not flag this as a governance failure
4. **The operational vs. technical distinction**: ShotSpotter's 97% accuracy is a different metric from the 9.1% operational evidence rate; Claude conflated them
5. **Pattern recognition**: Both cases show the same pattern — a private vendor proposes technology, a public entity adopts it without community input, and governance structures are either absent or unenforceable

Key points:

[Line 1] Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announced in February 2024 that Chicago would not renew its SoundThinking (formerly ShotSpotter) contract.

[Line 2] SoundThinking stopped providing gunshot alerts to Chicago police as of September 23, 2024, followed by a 60-day transition period.

[Line 3] The decision sparked political controversy: some alderpeople attempted legislation to allow City Council to decide ShotSpotter's continued use in their wards.

[Line 4] Following the contract's termination, the city issued a Request for Information (RFI) for "first responder technology" and "law enforcement technology."

[Line 5] A Cook County State's Attorney's Office review in February 2024 found ShotSpotter alerts led to arrests in only about 1% of cases over a five-year period.

[Line 6] Almost a third of those arrests did not involve a firearm.

[Line 7] Mayor Johnson had campaigned on discontinuing ShotSpotter use.

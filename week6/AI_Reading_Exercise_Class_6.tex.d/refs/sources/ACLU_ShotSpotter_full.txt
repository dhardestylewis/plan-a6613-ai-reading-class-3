Key points from ACLU analysis:

[Line 1] ShotSpotter places acoustic sensors in communities of color, often without community knowledge or consent.

[Line 2] The system operates as a surveillance tool that triggers armed police responses in neighborhoods already subject to over-policing.

[Line 3] The proprietary algorithm's inner workings are not disclosed to the public or to defendants in criminal proceedings.

[Line 4] The ACLU characterizes ShotSpotter as "a surveillance tool, not a public safety one."

[Line 5] Chicago paid $33 million for ShotSpotter between 2018 and 2021, later expanded to a $49 million contract.

[Line 6] The system was deployed in 12 police districts, all of which had predominantly Black and Latino populations.

[Line 7] No public hearings were held before contract renewals.

[Line 8] ShotSpotter alerts have been used as evidence in criminal prosecutions despite accuracy concerns, raising due process questions.

[Line 9] The technology creates a feedback loop: sensors are placed where crime has historically been reported, generating more alerts and police activity in those same neighborhoods.

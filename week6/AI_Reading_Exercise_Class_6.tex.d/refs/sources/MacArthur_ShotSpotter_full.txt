Key points from MacArthur Justice Center lawsuit:

[Line 1] Federal lawsuit filed July 2022 alleging Chicago police misused "unreliable" gunshot detection technology.

[Line 2] The suit alleges ShotSpotter sensor placement in primarily Black and Latino neighborhoods constitutes racially discriminatory policing.

[Line 3] The MacArthur Justice Center found that 86% of ShotSpotter dispatches in Chicago did not result in a case report of any crime.

[Line 4] 89% of ShotSpotter alerts did not result in police finding evidence of a gun-related crime (citing Northwestern Law School study).

[Line 5] The suit seeks damages and a court order barring the technology's continued use in the city.

[Line 6] ShotSpotter deploys acoustic sensors across 117 square miles of Chicago, covering 12 police districts.

[Line 8] The complaint documents specific cases where ShotSpotter alerts led to wrongful stops and detention of individuals in the sensor coverage area.

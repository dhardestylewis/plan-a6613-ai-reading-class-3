Key points from the MIDP:

[Line 1] Sidewalk Labs proposed Quayside, a 12-acre site on Toronto's eastern waterfront, as a testbed for sensor-driven urban management.

[Line 2] The plan envisioned adaptive traffic signals, automated waste collection via underground pneumatic tubes, and real-time energy optimization.

[Line 3] Data collection infrastructure included cameras, environmental sensors, weather stations, and mobile device tracking.

[Line 4] The governance model proposed a "Civic Data Trust" — an independent entity that would set rules for the collection, use, and sharing of "urban data."

[Line 5] Sidewalk Labs committed that it would not sell personal information or use it for advertising.

[Line 6] The 1,524-page Master Innovation and Development Plan was released in June 2019 in three volumes.

[Line 7] The plan proposed expanding the development from the original 12-acre Quayside site to a broader 190-acre area called the "IDEA District."

[Line 8] Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company), was selected by Waterfront Toronto in October 2017 through an RFP process.

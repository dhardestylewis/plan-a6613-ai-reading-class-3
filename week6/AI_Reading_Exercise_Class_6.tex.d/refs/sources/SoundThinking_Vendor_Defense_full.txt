Key points from SoundThinking's public defense:

[Line 1] SoundThinking claims 97% accuracy for real-time ShotSpotter detections across all deployments.

[Line 2] This accuracy figure was audited by Edgeworth Economics (a data analytics firm), which found 97.69% for 2019-2021 and 97.63% for 2022.

[Line 3] SoundThinking reports a false positive rate of 0.5% (alerts issued when no gunshot occurred).

[Line 4] The company argues that "nothing to report" police dispositions do not necessarily mean no gunfire occurred — physical evidence (shell casings) can be hard to locate.

[Line 5] SoundThinking's system uses a two-step process: machine classification followed by human analyst review at Incident Review Centers, aiming for alert dispatch within 60 seconds.

[Line 6] The company claims the system enables faster emergency response, potentially saving lives in cases where gunfire goes unreported to 911.

[Line 7] ACLU reported that SoundThinking CEO Ralph Clarke disputed their analysis and filed a defamation lawsuit against Vice News over critical reporting.

[Line 8] The ACLU also noted that SoundThinking turned down a request by the independent security technology research publication IPVM to carry out independent tests of its methodology.

[Line 9] A ShotSpotter expert admitted in a 2016 trial that the company reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet at the request of a police department, saying such changes occur "all the time" (ACLU, citing court testimony).

CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT:
- The 97% accuracy metric measures whether a sensor-detected sound is correctly classified as a gunshot.
  It does NOT measure whether police arrive and find evidence of a crime (the OIG's 9.1% metric).
  These are fundamentally different metrics measuring different things.
- The Edgeworth Economics audit was commissioned by SoundThinking — not an independent, arms-length review.
- The vendor refused IPVM's request for independent testing (ACLU reporting).
- Court testimony about reclassifying sounds at police request raises questions about evidence integrity.
- The "nothing to report doesn't mean no gunshot" argument is unfalsifiable — it cannot be verified or disproven.

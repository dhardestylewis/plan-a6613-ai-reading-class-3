Key findings from the OIG report:

[Line 1] The OIG analyzed over 50,000 ShotSpotter alerts occurring between January 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021.

[Line 2] CPD responses to ShotSpotter alerts rarely produced evidence of a gun-related crime.

[Line 3] Only 9.1% of responses (4,556 out of 41,830 alerts with reported dispositions) indicated evidence of a gun-related criminal offense was found.

[Line 4] Out of 50,176 confirmed and dispatched ShotSpotter alerts, only 1,056 (2.1%) led to a documented investigatory stop.

[Line 5] Police responses to ShotSpotter alerts seldom led to the recovery of a firearm.

[Line 6] Deputy Inspector General Deborah Witzburg stated the study was "not about technological accuracy, it's about operational value" and that the data "plainly doesn't" demonstrate significant law enforcement benefit.

[Line 7] The OIG identified that ShotSpotter technology had changed how some CPD members perceived and interacted with individuals in areas where alerts were frequent.

[Line 8] SoundThinking (then ShotSpotter) responded that its technology's accuracy had been independently audited at 97% based on customer feedback.

[Line 9] The OIG report cited a MacArthur Justice Center finding that 86% of incidents where CPD officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert did not result in the completion of a case report.

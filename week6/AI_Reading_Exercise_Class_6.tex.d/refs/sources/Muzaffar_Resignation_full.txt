Key points from verified sources:

[Line 1] Saadia Muzaffar, founder of TechGirls Canada, resigned from Waterfront Toronto's Digital Strategy Advisory Panel in October 2018.

[Line 2] Muzaffar cited "deep dismay" and "profound concern" (CTV News).

[Line 3] Her resignation letter stated she was stepping away due to "apathy and a lack of leadership regarding shaky public trust" from panel organizers concerning data and privacy issues (CTV, CBC, Smart Cities Dive).

[Line 4] She noted concerns about broad data licensing that might grant a foreign-owned company control over valuable public data.

[Line 5] She was the only person of color on the advisory panel (Smart Cities Dive).

[Line 6] Her resignation followed that of John Ruffolo (Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System) and occurred amid growing controversy around the Sidewalk Labs project.

[Line 7] Muzaffar resigned from Waterfront Toronto's panel specifically, not from a Sidewalk Labs advisory role (important distinction — she was advising Waterfront Toronto, the public partner).

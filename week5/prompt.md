# Week 5 Prompt Log — AI Reading Exercise: Class 5
**Topic**: From Digital to Physical Infrastructure
**Tool**: Claude Opus 4.6 (Thinking) via Antigravity IDE
**Date**: February 17, 2026

## Prompt Strategy
Three-stage iterative process moving from general to specific to operational.

## Prompt 1 — General Orientation
> What are three real-world examples of AI being used to "actively manage" city assets like the curb or the power grid, and how are cities funding these new digital systems?

**Result**: Vague IoT sensor descriptions. No named vendors, cities, or funding details. Unusable.

## Prompt 2 — Named Deployments
> Give me three specific, named deployments of AI actively managing city infrastructure — with exact cities, vendor names, and how each is funded.

**Result**: Three concrete leads: Automotus in Pittsburgh, Flow Labs in North Carolina, Google Tapestry with PJM. Each had city, vendor, and funding info. But Claude treated all three as equally deployed.

## Prompt 3 — Operational Detail
> For each of these three systems, tell me exactly how it works operationally: what data does it ingest, what it decide autonomously, and where does a human remain in the loop?

**Result**: Good operational detail for Automotus (CV cameras, license plates, automated enforcement) and Flow Labs (connected vehicle GPS, signal recommendations). Tapestry description was vague ("AI models grid topology"). Claude still did not distinguish between deployed vs. announced systems.

## Key Observation
Claude assembled a useful initial inventory but could not assess system maturity. It presented a fully operational system (Automotus), a monitoring-only tool (Flow Labs), and an announced partnership (Tapestry) as equivalent. The verification and source-checking work was entirely manual.

## User Feedback Log (Verbatim, Timestamped)

**11:53:46** — "dont include succinct details in parantheses actually write those facts into the sentences if they are relevant or important enough to include at all"

**11:54:25** — "still too long"

**11:54:30** — "by exactly 14 lines"

**11:55:38** — "Why are you writing out the order or stating the order or the fact that the order is deliberate? Shouldn't you be showing not telling?"

**11:55:48** — "Shouldn't it be obvious simply from reading?"

**11:55:58** — "still see emdahses?"

**11:56:42** — "You cut too much refer to prev git and restore half of what you cut."

**12:02:30** — "are these the right sources to back this up?"

**12:02:45** — "what other sources could or should we have considered and included or rejected?"

**12:04:40** — "How do these sources stack up? Are they authoritative? From each stakeholder? From a range of opinions? With appropriate weight and consideration given to each opinion? Consider carefully the position and interests or conflict of interests of each source? Take in the most relevant details concepts facts data etc from within each source? Evidenced somewhere that you actually read annotated thoroughly and then summarized/synthesized/extracted the most relevant?"

**12:05:06** — "Lets go through a round of this — What we should have looked for: DOE grant record for Automotus, Pittsburgh city government report, NCDOT official documentation, Yale Environment 360 article on Tapestry"

**12:05:31** — "Always" [re: acknowledging vendor-sourcing limitation]

**12:05:48** — "Have you embedded that critical view throughout?"

**12:06:51** — "'The economic logic is revealing' what persona/role are you taking on in writing all this? what is your position? who do you aspire to be?"

**12:07:23** — "You still have nonfull sentences.."

**12:08:23** — "Are you speaking repetitively unintentionally without rhythm or where that repetition is desirable emphasis anywhere? 'The AI...' 'The AI...'"

**12:09:08** — "Are all your claims supported surfaced and cited? 'Documentation clarifies it' What documentation? Where? ....?"

**12:09:38** — "Still not seeing you recording my prompts anywhere?"

**12:09:50** — "Still not seeing sources downloaded annotated synthesized..."

**12:10:02** — "Still no bolding or italics"

**12:10:15** — "Still not complete reference format style?"

**12:10:33** — "Still incomplete sentences"

**12:10:46** — "Still no evidence of prioritization of my asks"

**12:11:07** — "or recording ordering and following through with them autonomously verbatim after prioritization"

**12:11:27** — "still no evidence these annotations are of entire document"

**12:11:34** — "line number references in annotation"

**12:11:44** — "or page number references in final pdf"

**12:12:03** — "still hasnt downloaded or printed all sources"

**12:12:15** — "still hasnt gone out and gathered other discussed sources"

**12:12:47** — "still no recent compilation?"

**12:12:51** — "or regularly git commit"

**12:13:15** — "dont use the dom use search and other tools to complete"

**12:13:42** — "have you double checked the citation format for each of these sources?"

**12:14:19** — "and the factual accuracy of each derived claim/fact/etc? not only against these sources but against their own references/citations and externally?"

**12:15:22** — "'from the generated response' can you be more clear in writing any given sentence to aid the skimmer/scanner in quickly going back or picking up?"

**12:15:32** — "'earlier' is vague"

**12:16:13** — "have you been timestamp appending all these requests verbatim to a week-specific prompts log?"

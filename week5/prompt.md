# Week 5 Prompt Log — AI Reading Exercise: Class 5
**Topic**: From Digital to Physical Infrastructure
**Tool**: Claude Opus 4.6 (Thinking) via Antigravity IDE
**Date**: February 17, 2026

## Prompt Strategy
Three-stage iterative process moving from general to specific to operational.

## Prompt 1 — General Orientation
> What are three real-world examples of AI being used to "actively manage" city assets like the curb or the power grid, and how are cities funding these new digital systems?

**Result**: Vague IoT sensor descriptions. No named vendors, cities, or funding details. Unusable.

## Prompt 2 — Named Deployments
> Give me three specific, named deployments of AI actively managing city infrastructure — with exact cities, vendor names, and how each is funded.

**Result**: Three concrete leads: Automotus in Pittsburgh, Flow Labs in North Carolina, Google Tapestry with PJM. Each had city, vendor, and funding info. But Claude treated all three as equally deployed.

## Prompt 3 — Operational Detail
> For each of these three systems, tell me exactly how it works operationally: what data does it ingest, what does it decide autonomously, and where does a human remain in the loop?

**Result**: Good operational detail for Automotus (CV cameras, license plates, automated enforcement) and Flow Labs (connected vehicle GPS, signal recommendations). Tapestry description was vague ("AI models grid topology"). Claude still did not distinguish between deployed vs. announced systems.

## Key Observation
Claude assembled a useful initial inventory but could not assess system maturity. It presented a fully operational system (Automotus), a monitoring-only tool (Flow Labs), and an announced partnership (Tapestry) as equivalent. The verification and source-checking work was entirely manual.

## User Feedback During Drafting
- Remove em dashes throughout
- Spell out numbers (e.g., "more than 2,500" not "2,500+")
- Use APA inline citations, not numbered
- Show don't tell — remove structural announcements
- Don't use parenthetical shorthand, write facts into sentences
- Every sentence must be a full sentence
- Thesis-evidence-conclusion structure for each paragraph
- Voice should be planning student, not editorialist
- Avoid AIisms (illustrates, landscape, revealing, fundamentally)
- Varied sentence openers — no mechanical "The AI..." repetition
- Embed source criticism throughout, not just in reflection
- Surface vendor-vs-city data discrepancies
- Cite every claim with specific source
- Download, annotate, and synthesize all sources (matching week 4 standard)

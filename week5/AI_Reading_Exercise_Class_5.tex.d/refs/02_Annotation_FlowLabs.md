# Annotation: Flow Labs — NCDOT Statewide Traffic Signal AI

## Sources
- **Vendor**: Flow Labs. (2025). *NCDOT statewide AI traffic signal deployment*. https://www.flowlabs.ai
- **Tech journalism**: Nyczepir, D. (2024). NC deploys AI traffic signal software statewide. *StateScoop*.
- **Government journalism**: GovTech. (2025). North Carolina taps AI to help manage traffic signals statewide.
- **NCDOT comms**: Aaron Moody (assistant director of communications) quoted in GovTech: platform "supports data-informed decisions while maintaining oversight by engineering staff."

## Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder | Position | Potential Conflict of Interest |
|---|---|---|
| Flow Labs (vendor) | Claims "largest statewide AI traffic deployment in US" | Selling product; superlative claim is marketing |
| NCDOT | Deploying as one-year pilot, maintaining engineer oversight | Government agency; measured language about AI role |
| Jatish Patel (Flow Labs CEO) | "NCDOT embracing a new model for traffic operations" | CEO making sales case |
| Aaron Moody (NCDOT comms) | "supports data-informed decisions while maintaining oversight" | Government spokesperson; carefully avoids "AI controls" framing |

## Critical Distinction
Claude described this as AI "controlling" signals. The vendor's own documentation says it "recommends." NCDOT's spokesperson specifically says "maintaining oversight by engineering staff." Three sources converge on the same point: this is a monitoring and recommendation tool, not an autonomous one. Claude collapsed this distinction entirely.

## Key Facts Extracted
- 2,500+ intersections statewide
- Connected vehicle GPS data as primary input
- No new hardware or infrastructure required
- One-year pilot project structure
- SaaS contract embedded in operations budgets
- Machine learning identifies signal timing problems
- Human engineer makes all final decisions
- Became fully operational mid-2025

## Synthesis for Essay
This source set provides **Finding 2**: the monitoring-only example. The human-in-the-loop distinction is the key analytical contribution. The vendor and the government agency use carefully different language ("controlling" vs "recommends" vs "maintaining oversight"), and the AI flattened all three into one.

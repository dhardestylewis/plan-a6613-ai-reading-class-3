# DOE Vehicle Technologies Office Grant — Smart Loading Zones

## Grant Details
L1: $3.8 million grant awarded August 2021 by DOE Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO).

L2: Three-year grant period.

L3: Led by Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI), with Automotus as key partner.

## Partners
L4: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
L5: University of Southern California (USC)
L6: Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
L7: City of Santa Monica
L8: City of Los Angeles
L9: National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
L10: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)

## Scope
L11: At least $1 million of the $3.8 million specifically allocated to Pittsburgh's Smart Loading Zones research and scaling efforts.

L12: Project spans three cities: Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica.

L13: Installing up to 100 "smart" zones across the three cities.

L14: Automotus planned to expand to 200 smart loading zones across Pittsburgh by 2023.

## Goals
L15: Decrease emissions from idling and circling vehicles.
L16: Reduce parking-caused traffic by 20%.
L17: Cut double-parking incidents by 60%.
L18: Increase parking turnover for local businesses.
L19: Improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.
L20: Enhance delivery efficiency.
L21: Create roadmap for using curbside management to accelerate vehicle electrification.

## Significance
L22: Described as one of the first federal government funding initiatives for curb management.

L23: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Harvard Ash Center both covered as significant federal investment in curb tech.

## CRITICAL NOTE
- This grant establishes FEDERAL backing for Automotus, not just city-level
- The grant's goals (20% traffic reduction, 60% double-parking cut) differ from BOTH the vendor's and the city's reported outcomes
- The grant focused on zero-emission vehicle acceleration, not just curb management

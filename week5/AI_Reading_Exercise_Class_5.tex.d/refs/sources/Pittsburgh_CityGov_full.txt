# Smart Loading Zones — City of Pittsburgh Official Program

## Program Overview
L1: The City of Pittsburgh implemented a Smart Loading Zones curb management program as a collaborative effort between the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority (PPA), partnering with technology company Automotus.

L2: The program began as a one-year pilot in April 2022 and ran through December 2024.

L3: Goals: enhance delivery efficiency, reduce congestion and emissions, improve safety for all curb users.

## Implementation
L4: The initiative involved replacing existing loading areas with camera-enabled smart loading zones.

L5: The city received a $100,000 grant from Automotus for the initial pilot of 20 smart loading zones.

L6: Later, an additional $3 million in grants to expand the system.

L7: Technology was installed between January and March 2022.

## Technology
L8: The smart loading zones utilize license plate reading technology to analyze real-time curbside activity and automate payment.

L9: Drivers can identify these zones by their purple curbs and corresponding signs.

L10: Drivers register through a one-time CurbPass system.

L11: A 15-minute grace period is provided, after which drivers are automatically billed.

L12: The cameras capture license plate information solely for payment processing and do not collect other personal identifying information.

## City-Reported Results (January 2022 — December 2024)
L13: 70% increase in turnover, indicating more vehicles using the zones for short-term loading.

L14: 60% decrease in average park duration.

L15: Up to 85% of parks utilized the 15-minute grace period.

L16: A 40% decrease in double-parking was noted [city figure], which contributes to safer traffic flow.

L17: Carnegie Mellon University researchers found that strategically placed smart loading zones could boost traffic speed by as much as 4.5% in select areas.

## Expansion
L18: The program has grown from 20 to 75 locations since its launch in 2021.

## CRITICAL DISCREPANCY vs. Vendor Data
- City reports: 70% turnover increase, 60% park duration drop, 40% double-parking decrease
- Automotus vendor page reports: 40% turnover increase, 23% stay reduction, 95% double-parking decrease
- The 95% vs 40% double-parking gap is the most dramatic difference
- Different measurement methodologies or periods likely explain the discrepancy

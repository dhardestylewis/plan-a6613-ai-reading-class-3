# As Use of A.I. Soars, So Does the Energy and Water It Requires

## Core Argument
L1: Generative AI uses massive amounts of energy for computation and data storage and millions of gallons of water to cool data center equipment.

L2: Legislators and regulators in the US and EU are starting to demand accountability.

## Key Facts
L3: ChatGPT reached 100 million active users two months after its November 2022 release.

L4: AI use is directly responsible for carbon emissions from non-renewable electricity and for consumption of millions of gallons of fresh water.

L5: AI indirectly boosts impacts from building and maintaining power-hungry equipment.

## Legislative Response
L6: Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) introduced legislation requiring federal government to assess AI's environmental footprint and develop standardized reporting.

L7: EU "AI Act" approved by member states, requiring "high-risk AI systems" to report energy consumption, resource use, and other impacts throughout lifecycle.

## Environmental Tensions
L8: Tech companies cite ways AI could help reduce environmental footprint.

L9: But legislators, regulators, activists, and international organizations want to ensure benefits aren't outweighed by AI's mounting hazards.

L10: AI data centers are creating challenges for the electricity grid.

L11: Can indirectly contribute to keeping aging fossil fuel plants, including coal plants, online to meet soaring demand.

## Relevance to Tapestry Analysis
L12: Google positions Tapestry as helping integrate renewables into the grid.

L13: But Yale E360 documents that Google's own AI operations are a major driver of the electricity demand creating grid strain.

L14: This creates a conflict of interest: Google is partly solving a problem its own AI infrastructure exacerbates.

## CRITICAL NOTE
- This is the strongest INDEPENDENT counter-narrative to Google's Tapestry claims
- Yale School of the Environment is an authoritative, non-industry source
- Directly contradicts Google's framing of AI as purely beneficial for the grid

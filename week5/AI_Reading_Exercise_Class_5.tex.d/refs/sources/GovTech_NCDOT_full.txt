# North Carolina Taps AI to Help Manage Traffic Signals Statewide

## Key Facts
L1: NCDOT has deployed AI-powered traffic signal software from Flow Labs across more than 2,500 intersections statewide.

L2: Described as the largest live statewide deployment of AI-based traffic signal software in the United States.

L3: Became fully operational in the months leading up to July and August 2025.

## Technology Description
L4: The Flow Labs software utilizes machine learning and data from connected vehicles to continuously monitor intersection performance.

L5: Allows NCDOT engineers to detect issues, prioritize interventions based on real-world traffic patterns, and optimize signal operations.

L6: Does not require field studies, new hardware installations, or changes to existing infrastructure.

## NCDOT Official Quote
L7: Aaron Moody, NCDOT assistant director of communications, stated that the platform "supports data-informed decisions while maintaining oversight by engineering staff."

## Vendor Quote
L8: Jatish Patel, CEO of Flow Labs, stated that this deployment represents NCDOT "embracing a new model for traffic operations."

## Program Structure
L9: NCDOT is engaging in a "one-year pilot project" with Flow Labs.

L10: The pilot analyzes traffic and signal data to evaluate travel patterns and identify signal systems needing retiming.

## CRITICAL NOTE: Language Comparison
- GovTech (independent): "supports data-informed decisions while maintaining oversight"
- NCDOT official (Moody): "maintaining oversight by engineering staff"
- Flow Labs CEO (Patel): "new model for traffic operations"
- Vendor press materials: Flow Labs "monitors" and "recommends"
- Claude's initial response: described system as "controlling" signals
- CONCLUSION: Three independent framings all confirm human oversight; Claude overstated AI autonomy

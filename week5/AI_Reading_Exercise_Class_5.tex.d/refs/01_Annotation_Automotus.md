## Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder | Position | Potential Conflict of Interest |
|---|---|---|
| Automotus (vendor) | Claims 40% turnover increase, 95% less double-parking | Selling the product; stats are self-reported marketing |
| City of Pittsburgh DOMI | Reports 70% turnover increase, 60% drop in park duration | Justifying public investment, but less incentive to inflate |
| DOE VTO | Funds the $3.8M grant | Federal funder wants to show ROI on grant |
| CMU researchers | Found 4.5% traffic speed improvement in select areas | Academic independence, but partnered with city |

## Key Data Discrepancy
Automotus claims 40% turnover increase; city reports 70%. Different metrics or different measurement periods? Both parties have incentive to present favorably, but the vendor's numbers are lower than the city's, which is unusual. The 95% double-parking reduction (Automotus) vs 40% (city) diverge sharply — likely different methodologies.

## Key Facts Extracted
- 75 Smart Loading Zones (expanded from 20 in 2021 pilot)
- Computer vision cameras on streetlight poles
- License plate reading for automated payment via CurbPass
- 15-minute grace period before automated billing
- Tiered time limits for commercial loading
- Pilot ran January 2022 through December 2024
- $100K initial Automotus grant + $3M expansion + $3.8M DOE grant
- Closed operational loop: AI observes → decides → acts

## Synthesis for Essay
This source pair provides **Finding 1**: the most mature example. The vendor-vs-city data discrepancy is itself evidence for the critical analysis — even "verified" systems produce conflicting narratives depending on who reports. The DOE grant establishes federal investment, and the SaaS model establishes vendor revenue interest in favorable statistics.

## Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder | Position | Potential Conflict of Interest |
|---|---|---|
| Google X / Alphabet | Presents Tapestry as public-good AI for grid modernization | Google's data centers are major power consumers; faster interconnection directly benefits Google |
| PJM Interconnection | Announces collaboration as innovation in grid management | Regional transmission org managing 67M people; needs to show modernization progress |
| Yale E360 (independent journalism) | Reports that AI data centers are straining the grid and keeping fossil plants online | Independent environmental journalism; provides counter-narrative to Google's claims |
| Utility Dive (trade press) | Reports queue backlog: 79 GW solar, 37 GW storage, 23 GW wind | Industry-focused but factual on queue data |

## Critical Observation
Google positions Tapestry as a public benefit — accelerating renewable interconnection. But Yale E360 documents that AI data centers are themselves a major driver of electricity demand, meaning Google is partly solving a problem it is creating. This conflict of interest is not disclosed on the Tapestry page.

## Key Facts Extracted
- PJM serves 67 million people across 13 states + DC
- Interconnection queue: ~79 GW solar, 37 GW storage, 23 GW wind
- Uses Google Cloud + DeepMind AI
- Integrating dozens of existing databases into unified model
- Multi-year development partnership, NOT yet deployed
- Aims to automate data verification for land rights, equipment, grid impacts
- Google funds AI development; PJM provides grid data

## Synthesis for Essay
This source set provides **Finding 3**: the announced-but-not-deployed case. The conflict of interest between Google-as-energy-consumer and Google-as-grid-modernizer is the key analytical contribution, supported by Yale E360's independent reporting on AI energy demands. Claude did not flag this tension.

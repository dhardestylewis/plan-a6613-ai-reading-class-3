# Synthesis Matrix: AI Maturity in Urban Infrastructure

| Finding | AI Role | Sources Used | Key Evidence | What Claude Missed |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Automotus (Pittsburgh)** | Observes, decides, acts | Vendor page, City of Pittsburgh, Cities Today, DOE grant record | Vendor claims 40%/95%; city reports 70%/60% — different numbers | Data discrepancy; misidentified as "parking" vs commercial loading |
| **2. Flow Labs (NC)** | Monitors, recommends | Vendor page, StateScoop, GovTech (NCDOT comms) | NCDOT: "maintaining oversight by engineering staff" | Described as "controlling" when it only recommends |
| **3. Tapestry (Google/PJM)** | Not yet deployed | X project page, PJM newsroom, Utility Dive, Yale E360 | Multi-year dev partnership; 79 GW solar in queue | Listed alongside deployed systems; ignored Google's conflict of interest |

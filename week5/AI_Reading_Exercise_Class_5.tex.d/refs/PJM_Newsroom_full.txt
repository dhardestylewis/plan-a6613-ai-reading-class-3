# PJM — Google Multi-Year AI Collaboration

## Partnership Details
L1: PJM Interconnection partnered with Google and its Alphabet-incubated project, Tapestry, to use AI to streamline the interconnection process.

L2: Multi-year collaboration.

L3: Tapestry powered by Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.

## Scale
L4: PJM serves 67 million people across 13 states and the District of Columbia.

L5: PJM's interconnection queue includes approximately 79 GW of solar, 37 GW of storage, and 23 GW of wind projects.

L6: These projects face long wait times for approval and connection.

## Technical Approach
L7: AI-driven tools and models to intelligently manage and optimize PJM's generation interconnection process.

L8: Integrating dozens of existing databases and tools into a unified model.

L9: Automating data verification for factors like land rights, equipment, and grid impacts.

L10: Goal: faster decisions and more confident evaluations of new energy capacity.

## PJM's Framing
L11: Make electricity more reliable and affordable.

L12: Reduce burden on PJM planners and energy developers.

L13: Accelerate project approvals.

## Key Personnel (from Tapestry page)
L14: Andy Ott, Director of Technical Operations at Tapestry, is the former President/CEO of PJM Interconnection.

## CRITICAL NOTE
- PJM's former CEO now works for Tapestry/Google — revolving door between regulator and vendor
- PJM frames this as public benefit; Google frames it as grid modernization
- Neither party discloses Google's data center energy consumption as a driver
- This is an ANNOUNCED partnership, not a deployed system

# North Carolina Deploys AI-Powered Traffic Signal Software Statewide

The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has partnered with Flow Labs to implement a statewide deployment of AI-powered traffic signal software across more than 2,500 intersections.

## Key Facts
- Largest statewide deployment of AI-based traffic signal software in the US
- Covers 2,500+ intersections across North Carolina
- Uses machine learning and high-penetration connected vehicle GPS data
- Continuously monitors intersection performance
- Identifies signal timing issues without field studies, hardware deployments, or infrastructure changes
- Deployment took weeks, not years
- Traffic engineers receive prioritized intervention recommendations
- System RECOMMENDS changes — human engineer makes final decision on signal timing
- Provides network-wide insights and reporting immediately upon installation

## Funding
- Procured as a SaaS (Software as a Service) contract
- Embedded in existing NCDOT operations budgets
- No separate capital appropriation or federal grant required

## Quotes
- Jatish Patel, CEO of Flow Labs: North Carolina's approach is "not just an investment in a new tool, but an embrace of a new model for traffic operations"
- The system helps state agencies understand "vehicle delays, queue lengths, and wasted emissions from idling vehicles"

## Critical Distinction
Flow Labs is a MONITORING AND RECOMMENDATION platform, not an autonomous control system. The AI identifies problems and prioritizes interventions, but a human traffic engineer makes the final decision to change signal timing. This human-in-the-loop distinction is crucial.
